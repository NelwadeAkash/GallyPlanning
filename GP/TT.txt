5- try to load ct1 into ct2 and note down the observation.

Result:it will not possible to add because of date.

TASK-5:

1- Create 3 parts.(part-1,part-2,part-3)
2- Create a container tpe (ctype1) and associate any part as base part.(slots - 1, depth-36, height-2)
3- Create a container tpe (ctype2) and associate any part as base part.(slots - 3, depth-36, height-2)

4- Create the containers ct1 and ct2 acording to their container types.
5- Try to load ct1 into ct2 (1st slot) and save.Note down the observations.
6- Check the usage of ct1 and note down the observation.
7- Create one more contaniner ct3 and load ct2 into ct3( ct2 should occupy 2 slots in ct3).
8- Check the usage of ct1 and note down the observation.

Result:  1) container ct1 is discarded due to insufficent space.( 1st slot)
         2)  container ct1 is used in ct2 and ct3.

TASK-6:

After doing TASK-5 . try to delete ct1 and note down the observations.

Result: 1) container ct1 coud not be deleted.

TASK-7:

1- Create 3 parts.(part-1,part-2,part-3)
2- Create a container tpe (ctype1) and associate any part as base part.(slots - 1, depth-36, height-2)
3- Create a container tpe (ctype2) and associate any part as base part.(slots - 3, depth-36, height-2)
